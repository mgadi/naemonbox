Target audience
================
Before you start to dive deep into the documentation, we think it is fair to let you know if you get the right information out of the document or not. This documentation is intended for system administrators who want to get into monitoring and cluster management. It is also intended for user who only have to operate with the software but don't do any configurations.

The handbook provides also some background information about LINUX® commands in general, i.e. in context with package installation.

It does not deal with general monitoring themes or basic principles of monitoring or cluster management. If you wish to learn something about that, please save your time and look for a more suitable document in the world wide web or in your local specialised bookstore.
